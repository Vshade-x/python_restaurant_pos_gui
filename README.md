# PYTHON TKINTER POS SYSTEM | PROFESSIONAL RESTAURANT BILLING

### 🎯 Project Overview

This application serves as a complete Point-of-Sale (POS) and billing system developed using **Python Tkinter**. It demonstrates proficiency in complex **Business Logic**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and the creation of a clean, usable desktop graphical interface.

### ✨ Key Features & Technical Robustness

* **Object-Oriented Design (OOP):** The entire application (window, menus, calculator) is encapsulated within a single, stable class structure, ensuring modularity and easy maintenance.
* **Accurate Billing:** Implements precise financial logic to correctly calculate subtotals, taxes (7%), and grand totals. **Critical: Receipt generation is fixed to display costs accurately with two decimal places (cents), adhering to professional standards.**
* **Intuitive GUI/UX:** Features a professional, clean layout using the **Tkinter grid system** for stable resizing and clear separation of menus, costs, and calculator/receipt areas.
* **Input Robustness:** Includes error handling to prevent application crashes when users enter non-numeric values in quantity fields.

### 🚀 Execution and Usage

**1. Requirements:** Python 3.x and the Tkinter library (usually built-in).
**2. Execution:** Run the system directly from the command line:

    ```bash
    python restaurant_pos.py
    ```

**3. Functionality:** Allows users to select items, view costs, calculate totals, and generate a final, printable text receipt.
